FrontlineSMS v2 serial port debugging
------------------------------------

This script will send an email to FrontlineSMS with the following information:
- Some basic Java VM information, such as the version and architecture
- Some information about your computer, including the architecture, OS name & version
- Your logged in user account name (no other personal information will be sent)

It will also attempt to connect to serial ports on your computer using various methods, but will not transmit or receive data on any.

The entire process will usually take 1 or 2 minutes to complete.

Thank you for your help in making FrontlineSMS work across as many platforms as possible.
